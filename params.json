  "body": "#HexPy, technically, is a family of tools for creating, modifying, and displaying 8-byte color hexcodes. \r\n##_Non-technically, it's friggin awesome._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n####Currently HexPy is in Beta, accessible from a CLI only. Full code library coming soon.\r\n####This tutorial assumes you are familiar with a UNIX-based CLI and Python\r\n\r\n\r\n###Installation is easy:\r\n1. Have Python 3.4 or later installed. \r\n**Note: on most Linux distros, you must install `python3-tk` as well**\r\n2. Download and decompress the `.zip` or `.tar` from Github\r\n3. `cd` to the uncompressed directory\r\n4. Do `chmod 777 pgexec`\r\n5. Either add it to your PATH or run it with `./pgexec`\r\n\r\n###To test HexPy:\r\n1. Run the `ranhex.py` script to generate a test image.\r\n2. From a terminal do `pgexec imgtest.pgf`\r\n(You can also add a `v` at the end if you want to see verbose error reports.)\r\n\r\n\r\n###For more info, see the HexPy github repo. There's a link over there on the left.",
